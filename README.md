# GrapholScape
Advanced web viewer for ontologies written in [GRAPHOL](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~graphol/).

## Features
Grapholscape provides advanced and interactive tools to visually inspect all components of the ontology: you can search for predicates, filter elements on the diagram and get information about each element on the screen.
* Search for predicates and their instances through all diagrams contained in the ontology
* Re-arrange GUI's modules floating above the diagram
* Get detailed information about selected element
* Get the OWL2 translation for selected element
* Filter elements that are not necessary for your analysis
* Multi-diagrammatic inspection that allows you to navigate through all diagrams that builds up the ontology

## Usage | [Demo](https://gianluca-pepe.github.io/GrapholScape/)
You can try it [here](https://gianluca-pepe.github.io/GrapholScape/) or just clone the repository and open the index.html, then select an example or drop your custom .graphol file in the box on the right side.

## What is Graphol?
GRAPHOL is a visual language for developing ontologies and offers a completely graphical representation of ontologies to users, in order to be easy understood by people who are not skilled in logic.\

## About the project
I developed the project for my bachelor thesis for the Computer Engineering degree at Sapienza University of Rome mentored by [Domenico Fabio Savo](https://github.com/savo-fabio).\
This project has been integrated in [MASTRO STUDIO](http://www.obdasystems.com/mastrostudio), a web-based platform for data management through the OBDA paradigm developed by [OBDA Systems](http://www.obdasystems.com).

## Disclaimer
Based on [cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org).
