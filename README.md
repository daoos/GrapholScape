# GrapholScape

Advanced web viewer for ontologies written in [GRAPHOL](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~graphol/).

<img style="align:center" src="https://gianluca-pepe.github.io/GrapholScape/res/gif.gif" />
Grapholscape provides you advanced and interactive tools to visually inspect all the components of the ontology: you can search for predicates, filters elements on the diagram and have informations about each element on the screen.

## Usage | [Demo](https://gianluca-pepe.github.io/GrapholScape/)
You can try it [here](https://gianluca-pepe.github.io/GrapholScape/) or just clone the repository and open the index.html, then select an example or drop your custom .graphol file in the box on the right side.

## What's Graphol?
GRAPHOL is a completely visual language for developing ontologies and aims to offers a completely visual representation of ontologies to users, in order to help understanding by people who are not skilled in logic.\
